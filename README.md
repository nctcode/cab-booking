# CAB Booking System – Modern Microservices Architecture

A comprehensive, scalable, and real-time taxi booking platform built with a microservices architecture, event-driven design, AI integration, and Zero Trust security principles.

---

## 🚀 **Overview**

This project implements a modern **Cab Booking System** inspired by platforms like Grab/Uber. It is designed for **high scalability, real-time updates, event-driven communication, AI-powered services, and enterprise-grade security** using a Zero Trust model.

The system is **cloud-native**, containerized with Docker, orchestrated with Kubernetes, and ready for deployment on AWS/GCP/Azure.

## 🚦 **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+
- Kubernetes (for production)
- Kafka / RabbitMQ (or use provided docker-compose)

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cab-booking-system.git
   cd cab-booking-system
2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your config

3. **Start services with Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d

4. **Access services**
- API Gateway: http://localhost:3000

- Frontend: http://localhost:3001

- Kafka UI: http://localhost:8080

- PGAdmin: http://localhost:5050

- Grafana: http://localhost:3002

# Running Tests
    ```bash
    # Run tests for a specific service
    cd backend/auth-service
    npm test

    # Run all tests from root
    npm run test:all
---
## 🧪**Testing & Quality**
